## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the
build for the best performance.

### `npm run lint`

Lints the codebase using ESLint. This ensures your code adheres to specified linting rules and conventions. It
checks `.js` and `.jsx` files, reports any unused disable directives, and sets the maximum number of warnings to 0.

### `npm run preview`

Previews the production build locally. Useful for testing the production build before deploying.

### `npm run format`

Formats the codebase using Prettier. It targets all `.js` and `.jsx` files within the `src` directory to ensure
consistent code formatting.
